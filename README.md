### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Huck, I am looking for a junior Software Engineering position! <br>
I would like to work with a company that is environmentally conscious, and growth oriented.<br>
I enjoy working with React, JavaScript, Python and Ruby. But I also look forward to learning more tools, and I am always open to ideas.
